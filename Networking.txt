NETWORKING MASTER GUIDE 
________________


1. Introduction to Networking
* Networking connects devices to share data and resources.




* Internet = global network

* Web (WWW) = collection of webpages

* Origin: ARPANET → TCP/IP → modern Internet

* Protocols: TCP/IP

* Key concepts: HTTP/HTTPS, URLs, hyperlinks, search engines

Cross-reference: Diagram 1 shows Client-Server & HTTP flow (see next page!)




































GET:


[Client Browser] 
      |
      |  GET /index.html
      v
   [Router/NAT]
      |
      |  Forward to Server IP
      v
   [Server]
      |
      |  Response: HTML page
      v
[Router/NAT]
      |
      v
[Client Browser]
      |
   Displays page












POST:


[Client Browser]
      |
      |  POST /form-data
      v
   [Router/NAT]
      |
      v
   [Server]
      |
      |  Response: Success/Failure
      v
[Router/NAT]
      |
      v
[Client Browser]














2. Client–Server Architecture
   * Client = requests data

   * Server = provides data

Flow Example (See Diagram 1: Client-Server / HTTP Flow( right above this page ):
      1. Browser requests google.com

      2. Server receives request → processes it

      3. Server sends back webpage

      4. Browser displays it

Key idea: request → process → response


3. Protocols
         * TCP(Transmission Control Protocol): reliable, ordered (web browsing, emails)

         * UDP(User Datagram Protocol): fast, no guarantee (gaming, streaming)

         * HTTP / HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol and/or Secure): transfer webpages (HTTPS secure)


Protocol
	Port
	Use
	HTTP
	80
	Webpages
	HTTPS
	443
	Secure webpages
	DNS
	53
	Domain name resolution
	FTP
	21
	File transfer
	SSH
	22
	Secure remote login
	4. Data Transmission & Packets
            * Data is split into packets

            * Each packet contains: Source IP, Destination IP, Ports, Sequence Number, Payload

            * Routers forward packets; destination reassembles

See Diagram 2: Packet Structure
+-------------------------+
| Source IP               |
+-------------------------+
| Destination IP          |
+-------------------------+
| Source Port             |
+-------------------------+
| Destination Port        |
+-------------------------+
| Sequence Number         |
+-------------------------+
| Payload (Actual Data)   |
+-------------------------+


5. IP Addressing
               * Global IP = assigned by ISP

               * Local IP = assigned by router (DHCP), e.g., 192.168.x.x

               * NAT(Network Address Translation):maps multiple local IPs →single constant public IP

See Diagram 3: NAT + DHCP Flow

       DHCP assigns local IPs
           NAT maps to
        Public IP (ISP)

           [Internet]




6. Ports
                  * Ports = “doors” for applications
                  * It defines the application to where the data would be sent to

                  * Ranges:

                     * 0–1023: well-known (HTTP 80, HTTPS 443)

                     * 1024–49152: registered

                     * 49152–65535: private
7. Internet Speeds
                        * 1 Mbps = 1 million bits/sec

                        * 1 Gbps = 1 billion bits/sec

                        * Download = receive, Upload = send

9. Transmission Media
Wired: Ethernet, Coaxial, Fibre
Wireless: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular (3G/4G/5G), Satellite
How the Ethernet works/RJ45:
                           * Physical connection: Devices are physically connected to each other or to a central device like a switch or router using an Ethernet cable.
                           * Data transmission: Data is sent as electrical pulses through the wires in the cable.
                           * Protocol: A set of rules called a protocol (governed by the IEEE 802.3 standard) ensures that devices can format and transmit data in a way that other devices can understand.
                           * Collision detection: A system known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) manages the data flow and ensures that if two devices try to send data at the same time, they stop, wait a random amount of time, and try again. 
An RJ45 (Registered Jack 45) is the standard, 8-position, 8-conductor modular connector used for Ethernet networking, connecting devices like computers, routers, and switches via Ethernet cables
10. Global Internet Connectivity
                           * Submarine cables connect continents

                           * Data flow: Device → Router → ISP → Internet → Server → Back
11. Modem vs Router
Modem: digital converting to/from analog signals
        Router: routes packets, assigns local IPs (DHCP), NAT
Further Explanations: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other crucial network settings to devices (hosts) on a network 
This graph explains the Router better:

12. Network Topologies
                              * Various layout of how devices are connected

Bus Topology:
[PC1]---[PC2]---[PC3]---[PC4]
       (single backbone)


Ring Topology:
[PC1]---[PC2]
 |        |
[PC4]---[PC3]


Star Topology:

    / \       |       / \
 [PC1][PC2] [PC3] [PC4][PC5]




Note(All of the Topology listed above): All of the above layout is easy to establish but once main connection is corrupted, the whole connection is shut down


Mesh Topology:
[PC1]----[PC2]
 |  \   /  |
 |   [PC3] |
 |  /   \  |

🔄 How Data Flows (Very Important)
When sending data (your device → network):
It goes DOWN the OSI layers:
Application → Presentation → Session → Transport → Network → Data Link → Physical
Physical Layer sends electrical/light/radio signals out.
When receiving data (network → your device):
It goes UP the OSI layers in reverse order:
Physical → Data Link → Network → Transport → Session → Presentation → Application
This is how raw bits eventually become the web page, video, or text the user sees.




             




TCP/IP Model:


                                                * The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model used in real-world networking. It describes how data travels across networks like the Internet.

                                                                              * MAC addresses

                                                                              * Physical cables / radio

15. Subnets & VLANs
                                                                                    * Subnet: divide network
                                                                                    * VLAN(Virtual Local Area Network): logical separation of devices
How subnetting works
                                                                                    * A subnet mask is used to identify which part of an IP address represents the network or subnet and which part represents the host device.
                                                                                    * By using different subnet masks, a single large network can be divided into multiple smaller subnets. This is useful for both managing IP addresses and controlling traffic flow.
                                                                                    * For example, a network administrator could create a subnet for the marketing department and another for the sales department. This would prevent traffic from one department from unnecessarily congesting the network of the other
How VLAN works
                                                                                    * Logical Grouping: Devices (computers, printers, servers) are assigned to VLANs (e.g., VLAN 10 for Sales, VLAN 20 for Engineering) through switch port configuration.
                                                                                    * Frame Tagging: When data travels between switches, a small tag (VLAN ID) is added to the Ethernet frame, identifying its VLAN.
                                                                                    * Isolation: Switches read the tag and forward the frame only to ports belonging to the same VLAN, keeping traffic separate from other VLANs.
                                                                                    * Inter-VLAN Communication: Devices in different VLANs need a router or Layer 3 switch to communicate, adding a layer of control






16. Routing Basics
                                                                                    * Routers forward packets using IP addresses

                                                                                    * Protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP
Further information for Routers and routing:
Router packets refer to how routers (traffic cops of the internet) manage and forward small chunks of data called packets, using info in the packet's header (like IP addresses) and routing tables to send them efficiently across networks to their destination, making internet communication fast and reliable by breaking large data into manageable pieces. 
How Router Packets Work:
                                                                                       1. Data Splitting: A large file (like a webpage or video) is broken into many small packets.
                                                                                       2. Packet Structure: Each packet has:
                                                                                       * Header: Contains source/destination IP addresses, sequence numbers, and protocol info (like a mailing label).
                                                                                       * Payload: The actual piece of data.
                                                                                       * Trailer: Sometimes added for error checking.
                                                                                       3. Routing:
                                                                                       * When you send data, your device sends packets to your local router.
                                                                                       * The router reads the destination IP in the header and checks its routing table (a map of network paths).
                                                                                       * It forwards the packet to the next best router on the path.
                                                                                       * This process repeats across many routers until the packet reaches its final destination.
                                                                                       4. Reassembly: The destination device receives all the packets and reassembles them in the correct order to reconstruct the original data

1. RIP – Routing Information Protocol
                                                                                       * Type: Distance-vector protocol

                                                                                       * How it works: Routers share their routing tables with neighbors regularly.

                                                                                       * Metric: Number of hops (routers to reach destination)

                                                                                       * Limitations: Maximum of 15 hops → not suitable for large networks

                                                                                       * Use case: Small networks, labs, simple setups

large networks

                                                                                                            * Chooses paths based on policies, not just shortest distance

                                                                                                               * Advantages:
